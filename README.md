# cyclocomm
CycloComm lets cyclists communicate with drivers using an LED display triggered by hand gestures. A raised hand can show a crying face for apologies, while a wave can display a heart for thanks. By making intentions clear and emotions visible, CycloComm enhances road safety and fosters empathy between cyclists and drivers.
